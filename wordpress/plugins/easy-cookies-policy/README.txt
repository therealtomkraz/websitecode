== EU COOKIE LAW ==
The Cookie Law is a piece of privacy legislation that requires websites to get consent from visitors in order to store or retrieve any information from a computer, smartphone or tablet.
Easy Cookies Policy is the simplest way to comply with legislation regarding the usage of website cookies. It follows the notion of 'implied consent'. 
The plugin does not disable cookies on your site nor does it prevent the user from continuing to browse the site. If a user keeps surfing on your site by clicking on the "accept button" or by visiting another page on you site, the user is accepting the cookie policy.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How does it work? =
When a user enters your website, the plugin checks if it is a first time visit. It does so by checking if there are any cookies stored in the users browser  (in compliance with EU cookie law). 
If the plugin is not able to detect any cookies, a notice will be shown to the user encouraging him to accept the cookie policy. For that he will have to either click on the accept button or keep surfing on your website. 
Next time the user visits your website, this message will not appear.
